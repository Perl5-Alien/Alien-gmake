# ABSTRACT: Find or build GNU Make
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Alien::gmake ();
 use Env qw( @PATH );
 
 unshift @ENV, Alien::gmake->bin_dir;
 my $gmake = Alien::gmake->exe;
 system $gmake, 'all';
 system $gmake, 'install';

Or with L<Alien::Build::ModuleBuild>:

 use Alien::Base::ModuleBuild;
 Alien::Base::ModuleBuild->new(
   ...
   alien_bin_requires => {
     'Alien::gmake' => '0.09',
   },
   alien_build_commands => {
     "%{gmake}",
   },
   alien_install_commands => {
     "%{gmake} install",
   },
   ...
 )->create_build_script;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some packages insist on using GNU Make.  Some platforms refuse to come with GNU Make.
Sometimes you just want to be able to build packages that require GNU Make without
having to check the version of Make each time.  This module is for that.  It uses the
system provided GNU Make if it can be found.  Otherwise it will download and install
it into a directory not normally in your path so that it can be used when you 
C<use Alien::gmake>.  This way you can use it when you need it, but not muck up your
environment when you don't.

If possible, it is better to fix the package so that it doesn't require GNU make
extensions, making it more portable.  Unfortunately, sometimes this isn't an option.

This class is a subclass of L<Alien::Base>, so all of the methods documented there
should work with this class.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 exe

 my $gmake = Alien::gmake->exe;

Return the "name" of GNU make.  Normally this is either C<make> or C<gmake>.  On
Windows (and possibly other platforms), it I<may> be the full path to the GNU make
executable.

To be usable on all platforms you will have to first add directories returned
from C<bin_dir> to your C<PATH>, for example:

 use Alien::gmake ();
 use Env qw( @PATH );
 
 unshift @PATH, Alien::gmake->bin_dir;
 system "@{[ Alien::gmake->exe ]}";
 system "@{[ Alien::gmake->exe ]} install";

=head2 bin_dir

 my @dir = Alien::gmake->bin_dir;

Returns the list of directories that should be added to C<PATH> in order for the
shell to find GNU make.  If GNU make is already in the C<PATH>, this will return
the empty list.  For example:

 use Alien::gmake ();
 use Env qw( @PATH );
 
 unshift @PATH, Alien::gmake->bin_dir;

=cut

my $in_path;

sub import
{
  require Carp;
  Carp::carp "Alien::gmake with implicit path modification is deprecated ( see https://metacpan.org/pod/Alien::gmake#CAVEATS )";
  return if __PACKAGE__->install_type('system');
  return if $in_path;
  my $dir = File::Spec->catdir(__PACKAGE__->dist_dir, 'bin');
  Carp::carp "adding $dir to PATH";
  unshift @PATH, $dir;
  # only do it once.
  $in_path = 1;
}

sub exe
{
  my($class) = @_;
  $class->runtime_prop->{command};
}

=head1 HELPERS

=head2 gmake

 %{gmake}

Returns either make or gmake depending on how GNU make is called on your 
system.

sub alien_helper
{
  return {
    gmake => sub {
      # return the executable name for GNU make,
      # usually either make or gmake depending on
      # the platform and environment
      Alien::gmake->exe;
    },
  }

=head1 CAVEATS

This version of L<Alien::gmake> adds GNU make to your path, if it isn't
already there when you use it, like this:

 use Alien::gmake;  # deprecated, issues a warning

This was a design mistake, and now B<deprecated>.  When L<Alien::gmake> was
originally written, it was one of the first Alien tool style modules on
CPAN.  As such, the author and the L<Alien::Base> team hadn't yet come up
with the best practices for this sort of module.  The author, and the
L<Alien::Base> team feel that for consistency and for readability it is
better use L<Alien::gmake> without the automatic import:

 use Alien::gmake ();

and explicitly modify the C<PATH> yourself (examples are above in the 
synopsis).  The old style will issue a warning.  The old behavior will be
removed, but not before 31 January 2018.
